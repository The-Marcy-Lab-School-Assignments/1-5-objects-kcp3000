# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer

Shallow clone means that only the primitives are copied, but still is under the same object/array. This can cause bugs since the shallow clone isn't a brand new object/array, it could cause duplicate codes under the same array/object property and on a large scale can cause a massive mess.
