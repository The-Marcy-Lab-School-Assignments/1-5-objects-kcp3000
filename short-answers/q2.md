# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer

Pass by reference usually refers to arrays or objects, it typically means the values within an array or object is memorized by whatever is being changed. Pass by reference are mutable. Pass by value like strings, aren't mutable and unlike arrays or objects, strings aren't 'memorized' within the whole of the code and only based on the variable it's declared with.

Yup! One small correction, you should be saying `stored in memory` or `reference to memory` rather than `memorized`.
